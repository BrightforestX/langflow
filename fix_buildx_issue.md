It looks like the docker-buildx binary is not properly recognized or is incompatible with your system. The exec format error indicates that the binary might not be compatible with your system's architecture.

Let's troubleshoot and ensure docker-buildx is properly installed and compatible with your system.

Step 1: Verify the System Architecture
Check System Architecture:

sh
Copy code
uname -m
The output should be x86_64 for Intel/AMD 64-bit architecture or arm64 for Apple Silicon (M1/M2).

Step 2: Remove the Existing Binary and Re-download the Correct One
Remove the existing docker-buildx binary:

sh
Copy code
rm ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
Download the correct docker-buildx binary based on your system architecture:

For Intel/AMD 64-bit architecture (x86_64):

sh
Copy code
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.10.5/buildx-v0.10.5.darwin-amd64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
For Apple Silicon (arm64):

sh
Copy code
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.10.5/buildx-v0.10.5.darwin-arm64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
Make the binary executable:

sh
Copy code
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
Step 3: Verify the Installation
Verify docker-buildx installation:

sh
Copy code
docker buildx version
Step 4: Re-run the Build Command
Set BuildKit Environment Variable:

sh
Copy code
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
Run the Docker Build Command:

sh
Copy code
docker build . -f build_and_push_base.Dockerfile
This should resolve the issue if it was caused by an incompatible docker-buildx binary. If the problem persists, make sure that your Docker Desktop is updated to the latest version, as compatibility issues may also arise from outdated Docker installations.
